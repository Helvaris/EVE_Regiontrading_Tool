EVE Region Trading Tool

Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This is a small project I created to learn more about Python development, data processing, and GUI design. Itâ€™s a simple application to support region trading in EVE Online. The main idea is to read trade data from the clipboard and calculate some helpful insights.

What is this?
A very simple tool for region trading in EVE Online.
Python code that hopefully works as intended.
A basic graphical user interface (GUI).
Lots of room for improvement!
